### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we perform the following task:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure data quality.
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the HR data to answer the key questions, such as:

- How do performance ratings vary by department and job title?
- What is the salary distribution across different job titles and departments?
- Which job roles have the highest attrition rates?
- What is the overall attrition rate for each gender?

### Data Analysis

The analysis results are summerized as follow:
1. The overall attrition rate with notable variations across departments and demographics.
2. The attrition rate is higher among male employees compared to female employees.
3. Elaborate briefly department wise attrition.

### Recommendation

-  Increase engagement efforts in departments with high attrition, focusing on team-building activities, skill development programs, and manager-employee relationships.
-  Implement policies that promote better work-life balance, such as flexible working hours or remote work options, to support female employees, who may be more affected by work-life pressures.
-  For active employees, implement more performance recognition programs that reward and acknowledge contributions, helping to boost morale and prevent potential departures.

### Limitations

The analysis is limited by missing or incomplete data, which may affect the accuracy of insights, especially regarding performance ratings and reasons for attrition. Additionally, the study focuses on quantitative metrics and may overlook qualitative factors or external influences that could provide a deeper understanding of employee turnover.

### Conclusion

By addressing department-specific challenges, ensuring gender equity, and focusing on retaining active employees, HR teams can improve retention, reduce turnover, 
and foster a more engaged and satisfied workforce.
